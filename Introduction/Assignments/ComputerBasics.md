<h2>What is a Computer</h2>
<p>
    A computer is a machine that can receive, read, manipulate and send data. It combines both Hardware and Software to achieve it's funcionalities.
</p>
<h3>Hardware vs Software</h3>
<p>
    Hardware is the physical parts of a computer, it is the physical storage, processor, and renderer. It is used to create (or program) software, which itself runs in the hardware.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What is an Operating System</h2>
<p>
    Basically being a software, an Operating System - OS - is the most basic and fundamental piece of software a device must have. It is responsible for managing the device's memory and processor and allows the user to interact with the computer without needing to know the computer's language, oftenly via GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) or CLI (Command Line Interfaces).
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What is an Application</h2>
<p>
    An application is a software - a sequence of statements and commands - that is used with a certain purpose. That is, an Application is a piece of code that is responsible for executing a pre-determinated task in the device (through the OS).
</p>

<h2>Open Source vs Closed Source Applications</h2>
<p>
    Open Source and Closed Source are categories applied commonly in the programming world. An application being Open Source means that it's <a href="#source-code">source code</a> is public and, thus, anyone can read and contribute to it's development. On the other hand, Closed Source applications' <a href="#source-code">source code</a> isn't public and only the company/developer has access to changing and reading it.
</p>
<h3 id="source-code">Source Code</h3>
<p>
    Source code is simply the technical blueprint that tells a program how to function. It is it's program, the code itself.
